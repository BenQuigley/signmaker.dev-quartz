title: All My Disinterests

My Android phone has a news feed app, which is helpfully named just "Google". It
serves news articles from various sources based on your Interests, which it
tracks for you, but importantly, you can't customize your interests. You can
_confirm_ an interest that it suggests for you, which I apparently have done
three times. So, presenting for the first time, this complete list of my
interests and disinterests, courtesy of "Google" (you know, the news feed app
for Android):

## Interests

> - Art
> - Design
> - Mindfulness

I am a little surprised to see baking, programming, guitar playing, guitar
pedals, and climate change missing from this list, but I guess that an Interest
gets populated here only when "Google" (you know, the news feed app for Android)
shows me a story and I tap the ❤️ button to indicate my pleasure with that story
or its topic, _and_ I never tap the "☹️ Not interested in this topic" button on
the same topic later.

That last bit might be acting as the Great Filter here, because I click the "☹️
Not interested in this topic" button a lot. While the "Interests" section of my
preferences (which I am not allowed to add to) is sparsely populated, the "Not
Interested" section has grown wild:
