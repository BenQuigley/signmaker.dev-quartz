Welcome! I'm Ben, and this is my home on the internet.

I'm a software developer coming to you from [Warner Bros. Digital Labs](https://www.warnerbros.com/)
working on [DCUniverse.com](https://dcuniverse.com) and other high-traffic and -visibility webapps,
and from [EditShare](https://editshare.com/) writing high-performance Python code for video servers,
and most recently from [EquityZen.com](https://equityzen.com/), where I developed performant GraphQL
APIs, microservices, and data pipelines supporting a top-tier investment application.

More data about me:

* 🕷️ Software developer and data engineer (Python, GraphQL, REST, Airflow, Athena)
* 🦀 Strong professional interest in Rust
* 🌲 Climate activist
* 🚸 Twin parent
* 🥧 Baking & cooking enthusiast
* 🎸 Folk fingerstyle guitarist

## About signmaker.dev

"signmaker" is an old screen name. One of my favorite characters is [the Sign
Painter](https://worldofgoo.fandom.com/wiki/The_Sign_Painter) from the puzzle
game [World of Goo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_of_Goo). I call my site
[signmaker.dev](https://signmaker.dev) because putting up signs (or labels, web
sites, code comments...) is a pro-social, semantically deep act that can have
profound consequences in a system. As you might expect, I own a label maker and
know how to use it.

On a less philosophical note, this site is made with open-source
software:

* it is built using [quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/),
* and is hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).
